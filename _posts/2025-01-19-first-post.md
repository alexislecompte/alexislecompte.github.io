I have been contemplating the idea of starting my own blog for quite some time now, I have been feeling the need to document and share ideas, to set myself new objectives and create new challenges, to learn more effectively and to adopt a new form of discipline by regularly posting something interesting to read.

Therefore, I initialised my github pages a couple of months ago, re-discovering Jekyll in the process, but I decided that I wanted a shinny template for the blog and that I would craft this myself... Eventually, I wasn't able to commit the time required for this endeavour and I ended up prioritising other tasks and aspects of my life, leaving an empty repository where my blog was supposed take roots.

It is now the beginning of a new year, and I shall not let another year go without achieving this goal. Personal circumstances reminded me that time is precious, and a colleague recently told me that "better" is the enemy of "good", which immediately became one of my new mottos and a catalyst for action.

As I start this blog, I have a couple of ideas waiting to be implemented. Some are related to projects inspired by professional experiences, others are focused on video games development. This blog will be the perfect place to showcase and document these projects.

Stay tunned, more to come soon!
