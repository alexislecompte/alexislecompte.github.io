A colleague recently told me that "better" is the enemy of "good". This instantly became one of my new mottos and a catalyst for action.

I had been contemplating the idea of starting a blog for quite some time, but for various reasons, I never committed the time for it and put it off far too long.

As the new year starts, it is the perfect opportunity to finally kick this project off! I would like this blog to be a space where I will document and share ideas, a mean to set myself new objectives and challenges, a motivation to learn more effectively and a tool to adopt the necessary discipline to achieve these goals.

As I write this first post, I already have a couple of ideas waiting to be implemented. Some are related to projects inspired by professional experiences, others are focused on video games development. This blog will be the perfect place to showcase all of those.

Stay tunned, more to come soon!
