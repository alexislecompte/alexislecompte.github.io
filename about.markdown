Welcome on my blog!

Here you will find a random collection of posts, documenting personal projects and mostly focused on software development. Some of the topics of interest for this blog include but are not limited to Splunk app and add-on development, video games development, and perhaps a bit of cyber security and observability.

If you found any of these articles interesting and wish to talk to me, please feel free to reach out on Linkedin (link in the footer).

Happy reading!
